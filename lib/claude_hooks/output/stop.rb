      # === SEMANTIC HELPERS ===

      # Check if Claude should be forced to continue (decision == 'block')
      # Note: 'block' in Stop hooks means "block the stopping", i.e., continue
      def should_continue?
        decision == 'block'
      end

      # Check if Claude should stop normally (decision != 'block')
      def should_stop?
        decision != 'block'
      end

      # === EXIT CODE LOGIC ===
      #
      # Stop hooks use the advanced JSON API with exit code 0.
      # Per Anthropic guidance: when using structured JSON with decision/reason fields,
      # always output to stdout with exit 0 (not stderr with exit 2).
      # Reference: https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/10875
      def exit_code
        0
      end

      # === OUTPUT STREAM LOGIC ===
      #
      # Stop hooks always output to stdout when using the JSON API.
      # This follows the same pattern as PreToolUse hooks.
      def output_stream
        :stdout
      end

          output_data = output.respond_to?(:data) ? output.data : output

          next unless output_data['decision'] == 'block'

          merged_data['decision'] = 'block'
          reason = output_data['reason']
          blocking_reasons << reason if reason && !reason.empty?
